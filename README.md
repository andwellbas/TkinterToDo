# Tkinter ToDO project
The program allows you to create tasks for yourself and receive random ones. The number of completed tasks is counted and stored.
# How to run the program?
You need to run the main.py file. After that, 2 files will be automatically created (quests.db in which tasks will be stored, points_vault.dat to save the number of completed tasks). The program itself will have a button (?) detailing how to use the program's interface.
